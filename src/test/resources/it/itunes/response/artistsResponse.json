              "standard": "The Godfather of Soul, The Hardest Working Man in Show Business, Soul Brother Number One . . . Mountain-of-a-man nicknames, no doubt, but not one of them ever did James Brown the justice he deserved. JB\u2019s influence is so large it\u2019s plain impossible to imagine what music today would sound like without him. James didn\u2019t just master soul and funk; he invented them. From the on-bended-knee plea called \u201cTry Me\u201d straight to ground zero of the hip-hop revolution, where his screams, grunts, and funky drummer backboned every cut worth mentioning, Brown was soul power itself, an inspiration to an entire nation. Now that Mr. Dynamite has taken his last sweat-drenched shuffle offstage, we\u2019re all left like an awe-struck Apollo audience \u2014 still screaming for just one more encore while trying to take in the force of nature we were blessed to witness. James Brown\u2019s face should be on money. His likeness carved on a mountain. And, most importantly, his music played forever."
